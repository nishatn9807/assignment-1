The chicken is a domesticated bird that has been raised by humans for thousands of years, primarily for its eggs and meat. Originating from wild jungle fowl, chickens are now found in numerous breeds that vary in size, color, and behavior. They are known for their social nature and distinctive vocalizations. Chickens play crucial roles in both agricultural settings and as backyard pets.
