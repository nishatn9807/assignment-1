  The dog is a domesticated mammal that has formed a close relationship with humans over thousands of years. Dogs come from wolves and vary widely in size, shape, and temperament. Known for their loyalty and intelligence, dogs serve many roles from family pets to working animals in fields such as herding, therapy, and law enforcement.</p> </body>
