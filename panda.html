    The panda, also known as the giant panda, is a bear native to central China and is recognized for its striking black and white coat. Pandas primarily eat bamboo and have a diet that is unusually vegetarian for a bear. These gentle giants are a symbol of conservation efforts worldwide due to their endangered status and the global attention to their preservation.</p> </body>
